MUSIC GENRE CLASSIFICATION


The main aim of the project is to identify the genre of the music clips.

This is done using GTZAN dataset.

The Convolutional neural network is made using 3 convolutional and 4 linear layers .

For the input the spectograms were generated which were then passed to the convolutional neural network and with the help of genre as labels the classification was done.
